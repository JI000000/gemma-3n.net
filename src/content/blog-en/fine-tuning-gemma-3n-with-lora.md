Gemma 3n's base models are incredibly powerful, but its true potential is unlocked when you fine-tune it for your specific domain or task. Whether you want to create a chatbot that understands your company's jargon or a code assistant that knows your proprietary libraries, fine-tuning is the key.

In this guide, we'll explore one of the most popular and efficient methods for this: **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**.

### What is LoRA and Why Use It?

Traditional fine-tuning requires updating all the weights of a massive model, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive. It's like re-training the entire model from scratch, but with your new data.

LoRA takes a smarter approach. Instead of changing the original weights, it "freezes" them and injects smaller, trainable "rank decomposition matrices" into the layers of the Transformer architecture.

**The key benefits are:**
- **Drastically Reduced Memory:** You only need to train and store the small adapter matrices, not a full copy of the model for each task.
- **Faster Training:** Fewer parameters to update means training completes much faster.
- **Easy Switching:** You can easily swap LoRA adapters on the fly to change the model's specialized skill.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's get our environment ready. You'll need Python and a package manager like `pip`. We'll be using Hugging Face's `transformers`, `peft` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), and `datasets` libraries.

```bash
pip install transformers torch peft datasets accelerate
```

Make sure you have a GPU available for this process, as fine-tuning, even with LoRA, is demanding.

### Step 2: Preparing Your Dataset

For this example, let's imagine we want to fine-tune Gemma 3n to generate witty, one-line movie reviews. Our dataset might look like this in a simple `.jsonl` file:

```json
{"text": "A cinematic masterpiece that redefines the genre."}
{"text": "Two hours I'll never get back. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text": "Visually stunning, but the plot was thinner than my patience."}
```

You can load this easily using the `datasets` library.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your custom dataset
dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files='my_movie_reviews.jsonl')
```

### Step 3: Configuring the LoRA Adapter

This is where the magic happens. We'll load the base Gemma 3n model and then define our LoRA configuration using the `peft` library.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

model_name = "google/gemma-3n-base" # Fictional model name for demonstration
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Define the LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,  # Rank of the update matrices. Higher can mean more expressive, but more params.
    lora_alpha=32, # Alpha scaling factor.
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"], # Target the query and value projections in attention layers.
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)

# Apply the LoRA adapter to the model
lora_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

# You can print the trainable parameters to see the difference!
lora_model.print_trainable_parameters()
# trainable params: 4,194,304 || all params: 2,510,422,016 || trainable%: 0.16707
```

Notice how few parameters are actually trainable! That's the power of PEFT.

### Step 4: Training the Model

Now, we use the standard `Trainer` from the `transformers` library, but we pass it our `lora_model` instead of the original one.
